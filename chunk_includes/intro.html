<p>
In order to participate in this experiment, you need to be a native speaker of American English (i.e. you must have moved to the U.S. before the age of 6 and you must have lived there most of your life). Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>Sentences will be presented word-by-word, with each word intially represented by a dash proportional to its length. You will advance through sentences by pressing the SPACE bar. Each sentence will be displayed on a separate line.</p>

<p>We are interested in how fast these sentences can be read while you still understand them. That's why each of the snippets will be followed by a content question about them.</p> 

<p>
Try to answer those questions as fast as possible but also as accurately as possible given the content of the most recently displayed dialogue snippet. You can answer "yes" by pressing 1 and answer "no" by pressing 2 (you will be reminded of that every time you see a question). For example, you might read:</p>
<pre>
    He bought himself a new car by some American car company.
</pre>

<p>And you might be asked:</p>
<pre>
    Are cars always expensive?
</pre>
<p>The correct answer here would be 'No' since this information is not given in the dialogue snippet.</p>

<p>
At the end of the experiment you will be given a code to paste into the HIT on Mechanical Turk to verify that you completed the experiment.</p>

<p>
Feedback about the experiment is always welcome. Thank you for helping us understand the cognitive processes involved in reading.
